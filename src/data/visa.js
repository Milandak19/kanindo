            up your own company (PMA Company) in Indonesia, to support your daily activities later,
            you are required to have the right visa for you, namely a work visa / KITAS. For companies that
            will employ foreign workers in Indonesia, they are required to have a work permit for foreign workers
            “IMTA” from the Ministry of Manpower or in other words the foreign worker must have a “WORK PERMIT”. And to
            be able to get a “Work Permit / IMTA” the company is required to pay a “DPKK” retribution fee of USD 100 per month
            of service or USD 1200 for a 12 month period of service which is paid through the BANK to an account belonging to the
            Ministry of Manpower. Meanwhile, for a Director who owns shares in a PMA company with a minimum share size of 1.2
            billion IDR, he can have an Investor Visa / KITAS valid for 2 years and at the same time have a work permit without
            having to pay “DPKK” funds of USD 1200/year or USD 2400/ 2 years.`,

And another advantage is that you can take care of / get a Certificate of Good Behavior / SKCK from the Indonesian National Police, when you need the letter one day. Many of our clients who have lived in other countries who previously lived and worked in Indonesia for a long time require a Certificate of Good Behavior / SKCK for the purpose of applying / extending their visa in the country where they currently reside, because the authorities in that country request a Police Clearence / SKCK letter from Indonesian police. There are several other advantages such as :</p>
            <p>1. You can get a driver’s license / SIM valid for 1 year<br>2. You can open an account at a local bank<br>3. You can apply for a credit card<br>4. You can Register a mobile phone</p>`,

Manpower or letters of recommendation from other ministries, where to get it requires a long time and a fairly complicated process, as happens in the process of applying for a regular work visa. Another form of convenience is being given the opportunity to apply for a Permanent Stay Visa/KITAP which is valid for 5 years and also an opportunity to apply for Indonesian citizenship if they are interested. With the issuance of the latest regulations several years ago regarding the provision of many convenience facilities for foreign investors, the granting of this investor visa is one manifestation of the convenience provided by the government to investors.

After you stay 60 days then you are required to leave the territory of Indonesia and you can re-enter on another day using the visa and will be given a stay permit for the next 60 days. That’s how this type of visa works.
