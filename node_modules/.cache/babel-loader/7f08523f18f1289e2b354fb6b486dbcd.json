For companies that\n            will employ foreign workers in Indonesia, they are required to have a work permit for foreign workers\n            “IMTA” from the Ministry of Manpower or in other words the foreign worker must have a “WORK PERMIT”. And to\n            be able to get a “Work Permit / IMTA” the company is required to pay a “DPKK” retribution fee of USD 100 per month\n            of service or USD 1200 for a 12 month period of service which is paid through the BANK to an account belonging to the\n            Ministry of Manpower.
